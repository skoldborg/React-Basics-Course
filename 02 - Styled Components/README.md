# 01 - Startup

Welcome to this course on the basics of React (among other things)! In today's lesson we'll make sure that we have our development environment set up properly, so that we have all the tools needed to make life as a Front End dev as smooth as possible. Once that is done we will move onto React - learning what it is, setting up a new project, and creating our first component.
