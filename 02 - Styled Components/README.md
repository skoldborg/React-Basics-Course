# 01 - CSS-in-JS with Styled Components

In this lesson we will get familiar with the concept of CSS-in-JS and more specifically, [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

## Assignments

1. In order to use Styled Components we need to install it. Run this in your terminal (yarn or npm depending on preference):

    ```sh
    npm install styled-components
    ```

    And then run this to install the Styled Components types as dev dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install -D @types/styled-components
    ```

2. Go to your existing Button component and replace the `Button.css` file with a styled component (you can delete the `.css` file). The style declarations can be copied as is (without the class names) and features such as nesting and pseudo selectors will work out of the box!

    You can write your styled component straight inside `Button/index.tsx`, no need for second file just for styles (in this case).
